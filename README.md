# SoftwareGarageProject

PROJECT DETAILS:

Applying the Object-Oriented concepts (Abstraction, polymorphism,
interfaces, packaging, …) utilizing Boundary, control and entity concepts as well as SOLID
Principles to design a Parking Garage application and implement it using an objectoriented programming language. 
This application manages a parking space for a
configurable maximum number of vehicles. Each parking space (slot) defined with a
dimension (width and depth) The designed application must handle the following functions:
    • Each vehicle shall be identified by a model name, unique identification number, Model
    year and vehicle dimensions (vehicle width and depth).
    • Park-in function that marks the arrival time of a vehicle if there is an available slot. The
    application shall capture such time automatically from the system.
    • During the park-in function the application shall pick a free slot based on the active slot
    configuration. There are two configurations (i) first come first served slots i.e., the park-in
    function will use the first free slot available from the parking garage slots. (ii) best-fit
    approach where you need to find the slot with the minimum dimension to hold the vehicle.
    • Park-out function that marks the departure time of a vehicle from the garage. The
    application shall capture such time automatically from the system.
    • Calculate the parking fees during the park-out based on the time-of-stay with an hourly
    rate of 5 EGP.
    • Calculate the total income as well as the total number of vehicles that used the parking
    garage at any given point in time.
    • Display the available parking slots
    • Enrich your application with the capability to handle a set of exceptions that can happen
    during user interaction and through any other calculations. The displayed error message
    for exceptional behavior should be descriptive

section.
4- A word document includes answering the following question:
    ○ Does your class diagram respect or violate SOLID principles? Justify your answer.
    ○ Does your class diagram contain any design pattern(s), if yes name it and list the 
    names of the classes involved in such pattern(s).
